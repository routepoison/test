<h1><p align="CENTER"> Introduction to Relation</p></h1>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The <font color="green"><b>relation</font></B> we are going to study here is 
an abstraction of
relations we see in our everyday life such as those between parent and child, 
between car and owner,
among name, social security number, address and telephone number etc. We are going 
to focus our attention on one key property which all the everyday relations
have
in common, define everything that has that property as a relation, and study
properties of those relations.

One of the places where relation in that sense is used is data base management systems.
Along with hierarchical and network models of data, the <font color="green"><I>relational model</I></font> is
widely used to represent data in a database.
In this model the data in a database are represented as a collection of
relations. Informally, each relation is like a table or a simple file.
For example, consider the following table.
<BR>
<BR>
<table border align=left clospan=35>
<CAPTION><B>Employee</B></CAPTION>
<tr>
<th>  Name </th> <th>Address</th> <th align=center> Home Phone </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Amy Angels </td> <td>35 Mediterranean Av.</td> <td> 224-1357 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Barbara Braves </td> <td>221 Atlantic Av. </td> <td> 301-1734 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Charles Cubs</td> <td>312 Baltic Av.</td> <td> 223-9876 </td>
</tr>
</table>

Each row of this table represents a collection of data values such as
name, address, and telephone number of a person.
Each row is considered an instance of a relation and the table as the 
collection of the rows is considered a <font color="green"><B> relation</B> </font>, which is the relation
we are going to be studying in this chapter. Operations such as inserting or deleting entries to or from
a table, merging two table, finding the intersection of two tables, and searching for certain entries
can be described simply and precisely as operations on relations, and known mathematical results
on relations can be utilized without reinventing them. 
<BR>
The relational model is flexible (easy to expand, easy to 
modify) and interface to query languages is simple. It is thus widely used today.
