		<P align="justify">The concept of set is fundamental to mathematics and computer 
			science. Everything mathematical starts with sets. For example, relationships 
			between two objects are represented as a set of ordered pairs of objects, the 
			concept of ordered pair is defined using sets, natural numbers, which are the 
			basis of other numbers, are also defined using sets, the concept of function, 
			being a special type of relation, is based on sets, and graphs and digraphs 
			consisting of lines and points are described as an ordered pair of sets.
			<BR>

			Though the concept of set is fundamental to mathematics, it is not defined 
			rigorously here. Instead we rely on everyone's notion of "set" as a collection 
			of objects or a container of objects. In that sense "<a name="set"><font color="red"><B>set</B></font></a>" 
			is an undefined concept here. Similarly we say an object "<a name="blg"><font color="red"><B>belongs 
						to</B></font></a> " or "<font color="red"><B>is a member of</B></font>" 
			a set without rigorously defining what it means. "An object(element) <B><I>x</I></B>
			belongs to a set <B><I>A</I></B>" &nbsp;is symbolically represented by&nbsp; "<FONT color="red"><B><I>x</I>
					<IMG height="24" src="../symbols_sets/in.gif" width="16" align="middle" border="0">
					<I>A</I></B></FONT>" <B>. </B>It is also assumed that sets have certain 
			(obvious) properties usually asssociated with a collection of objects such as 
			the union of sets exists, for any pair of sets there is a set that contains 
			them etc.

			This approach to set theory is called "<a name="naiv"><font color="red"><B>naive set theory</B></font></a>
			" as opposed to more rigorous "axiomatic set theory".&nbsp; It was first 
			developed by the German mathematician Georg Cantor at the end of the 19th 
			century. For more on naive and axiomatic set theories <a href="naive_v_axiomatic.html">

				</r></a></B>which is not required for this course. Though the naive set 
			theory is not rigorous, it is simpler and practically all the results we need 
			can be derived within the naive set theory. Thus we shall be following this 
			naive set theory in this course.
