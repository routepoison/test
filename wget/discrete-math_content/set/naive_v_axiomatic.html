		<P align="justify">As given in Introduction to Set Theory of this&nbsp;course 
			material,&nbsp;&nbsp;the concept of set&nbsp;is not defined rigorously 
			in&nbsp;the naive set thoery which was originated by Georg Cantor.&nbsp;There 
			we&nbsp;rely on everyone's notion of "set" as a collection of objects or a 
			container of objects. In that sense "<a name="set"><font color="red"><B>set</B></font></a>
			" is an undefined concept. Similarly we say an object "<a name="blg"><font color="red"><B>belongs 
						to</B></font></a> " or "<font color="red"><B>is a member of</B></font>" 
			a set without rigorously defining what it means. It is also assumed that sets 
			have certain (obvious) properties usually asssociated with a collection of 
			objects such as the union of sets exists, for any pair of sets there is a set 
			that contains them etc.&nbsp;For example, P. Halmos lists those properties 
			as&nbsp; axioms in his book "Naive Set Theory" as follows:</P>
		<P align="justify">1. Axiom of extension</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Two sets are equal if and only if they have the 
			same elements.</P>
		<P align="justify">For example {1, 2} = {1, 2, 1} because every element of {1, 2} 
			is in {1, 2, 1} and vice versa.</P>
		<P align="justify">2. Axiom of specification</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp;every set&nbsp;S and every proposition P, 
			there is a set&nbsp; which contains those elements&nbsp;of S which satisfy P 
			and nothing else.&nbsp;</P>
		<P align="justify">For example let S be the set of natural numbers and let P be the 
			proposition that states for every object x that x is an even number. Then this 
			axiom states that there is a set that contains all the even natural numbers.</P>
		<P align="justify">3. Axiom of pairs</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; For any two sets there is a set which contain both 
			of them and nothing else.</P>
		<P align="justify">For example for sets {1} and {1,2} there is a set that contains 
			both of them. For example {{1}, {1,2}} is such a set in fact that is the only 
			such set.</P>
		<P align="justify">4. Axiom of union</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; For every collection of sets, there is a set that 
			contains all the elements and only those that belong to at least one 
			set&nbsp;in the collection.</P>
		<P align="justify">For example for every natural number i let A<SUB>i</SUB> = {2<SUP>0</SUP>, 
			2<SUP>1</SUP> , 2<SUP>2</SUP>, ..., 2<SUP>i</SUP>}.&nbsp; Then there is a set 
			that contains all the powers of 2 and only those,&nbsp;that is &nbsp;{2<SUP>0</SUP>, 
			2<SUP>1</SUP> , 2<SUP>2</SUP>, ..., 2<SUP>i</SUP>, ...}.</P>
		<P align="justify">5. Axiom of powers.
		</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; For each set A there is a collection of sets 
			that&nbsp;contains all the subsets of the set A and nothing else.&nbsp;</P>
		<P align="justify">For example a set that contains all the subsets of the set of 
			natural numbers exists, that is there is a set that contains all the sets of 
			natural numbers.</P>
		<P align="justify">6. Axiom of infinity</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a set containing 0 and the successor of 
			each of its elements.</P>
		<P align="justify">Here 0 is defined to be the empty set and the successor of&nbsp; 
			an element x , denoted by x<SUP>+</SUP>, is the set obtained by adding element 
			x to the set x&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp; x<SUP>+</SUP> = x <img src="../symbols_sets/cup.gif">
			{x}.Therefore 0<SUP>+</SUP> = 0 <img src="../symbols_sets/cup.gif"> {0} = {0} 
			which is denoted as 1. Then 1<SUP>+</SUP> = 1 <img src="../symbols_sets/cup.gif">
			{1} = {0, 1}&nbsp;= &nbsp;{0} <img src="../symbols_sets/cup.gif"> {{0}} = {0, 
			{0}} which is denoted as 2. 2<SUP>+</SUP> = 2 <img src="../symbols_sets/cup.gif">
			{2} = {0, 1} <img src="../symbols_sets/cup.gif"> {2} = {0, 1, 2} = {0, {0}, {0, 
			{0}}}, which is dented as 3 etc.
		</P>
		<P align="justify">Thus a set containing 0 and the successor of each of its 
			elements contains 0, 1, 2, 3, ...&nbsp; and possibly some more.&nbsp; Such sets can be employed to rigorously describe the concept of infinity. The 
			smallest of such set is defined to be the set of natural numbers and&nbsp;an 
			element of that set is a natural number.&nbsp;</P>
		<P align="justify">7. Axiom of choice</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cartesian product of a non-empty&nbsp;indexed 
			collection&nbsp;of non-empty sets is non-empty. In other words if {A<SUB>i</SUB>} 
			is a collection of non-empty sets indexed by a non-empty set I, then there is 
			an indexed collection {x<SUB>i</SUB>} such that x<SUB>i</SUB> is an element of 
			A<SUB>i</SUB> for each i in I.&nbsp;</P>
		<P align="justify">For example for every natural number i let A<SUB>i</SUB> = {2<SUP>0</SUP>, 
			2<SUP>1</SUP> , 2<SUP>2</SUP>, ..., 2<SUP>i</SUP>}.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;{A<SUB>0</SUB>, 
			A<SUB>1</SUB>, A<SUB>2</SUB>, ...} is a collection of infinitely many non-empty 
			sets. The axiom of choice guarantees that we can choose an element from each of 
			these&nbsp;A<SUB>i</SUB> 's simultaneously. This axim guarantees simultaneous 
			choice of elements from an infinite as well as finite collection of sets.</P>
		<P align="justify">&nbsp;</P>
		<P align="justify">Using those properties a&nbsp;naive set theory develops concepts 
			of ordered pair, relation, and function, and discusses their 
			properties,&nbsp;which are basically followed in the course material for this 
			course. It further discusses numbers, cardinals, ordinals, &nbsp;their 
			arithmetics, and finally different kinds of infinity, in particular 
			uncountability of&nbsp; the set of real&nbsp; numbers.</P>
		<P align="justify">In the naive set theory originated by Cantor the concept of set 
			was not defined. In particular no attention was paid to the nature of elements 
			of sets.&nbsp; Since a set is understood to be&nbsp;a collection of 
			objects,&nbsp; it was&nbsp;assumed that&nbsp;any object can be a member of a 
			set. However, Russell's paradox showed that that was not the case, that is, not 
			every object can be a member of a set. The paradox proceeds as follows:</P>
	Let S = { x :  x is set and  x <img align="middle" SRC="../symbols_sets/not_in.gif"> x }. Then since anything can be in a set, S is a set.<BR>
Hence S <img align="middle" SRC="../symbols_sets/not_in.gif"> S or S <img align="middle" SRC="../symbols_sets/in.gif"> S. If  S <img align="middle" SRC="../symbols_sets/not_in.gif"> S, then by the definition of S, S <img align="middle" SRC="../symbols_sets/in.gif"> S, which is a contradiction. Thus S <img align="middle" SRC="../symbols_sets/in.gif"> S.
However, then again by the definition of S, S <img align="middle" SRC="../symbols_sets/not_in.gif"> S, which is also a contradiction. Thus S can not be a set. That is, there are objects which can not be in a set.

To avoid the Russell's paradox axiomatic set theories have been developed. <a href="./ZFC.html"><r> <font color="blue">Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory </font></r></a> is one such theory which is widely accepted.
