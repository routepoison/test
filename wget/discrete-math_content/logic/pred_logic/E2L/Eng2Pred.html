<h3><font color="green">Contents</font></h3>
English sentences appearing in logical reasoning can be expressed as a wff. 
This makes the expressions compact and precise. It thus eliminates possibilities of misinterpretation 
of sentences. The use of symbolic logic also makes reasoning formal and mechanical, contributing to
the simplification of the reasoning and making it less prone to errors. </P>
Transcribing English sentences into wffs is sometimes a non-trivial task. 
In this course we are concerned with the transcription using given predicate symbols
and the universe. 
<BR>
<font color="blue"><B>To transcribe a proposition</font></B> stated in English using a given set of
predicate symbols, first restate in English the proposition using the predicates, connectives, and
quantifiers. Then replace the English phrases with the corresponding symbols. 
<BR><BR>
<font color="blue"><B>Example</font>:</B> Given the sentence "Not every integer is even", the predicate "<I>E(x)</I>" 
meaning <i>x</I> is even, and that the universe is the set 
of integers, 
<BR>
first restate it as "It is not the case that every integer is even"
or "It is not the case that for every object <i>x</I> in the universe, <i>x</i> is even."
<BR>
Then "it is not the case" can be represented by the connective "<img src="../symbols/not.gif">",
"every object x in the universe" by "<img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <i>x</i>", and "<i>x</i>
is even" by <i>E(x)</i>. 
<BR>
Thus altogether wff becomes <img src="../symbols/not.gif">
<img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <I>x E(x)</i>.
<BR>
<BR>
This given sentence can also be interpreted as "Some integers are not even".
Then it can be restated as "For some object <i>x</i> in the universe, <i>x</i>
is not even". Then it becomes <img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> <I>x <img src="../symbols/not.gif">
E(x)</i>.

<BR>
<BR>
<font color="blue">More examples:</font>
A few more sentences with corresponding wffs are given below. The universe is assumed to be the set of integers, <I> E(x)</i> represents
<i>x</i> is even, and <I> O(x)</i>, 
<i>x</i> is odd.
<BR>
<BR>
"Some integers are even and some are odd" can be translated as 
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> <I>x E(x) <img src="../symbols/and.gif"> 
<img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> x O(x) </i>
<BR>
<BR>
"No integer is even" can go to 
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <I>x <img src="../symbols/not.gif"> E(x)</i>
<BR>
<BR>
"If an integer is not even, then it is odd" becomes
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <I>x [ <img src="../symbols/not.gif"> E(x)
<img src="../symbols/imp.gif">  O(x)] </i>
<BR>
<BR>
"2 is even" is
<BR>
<i>E(2)</i>
<BR><BR>
<font color="blue"><B>More difficult translation</font>:</B>
In these translations, properties and relationships are mentioned for certain
type of elements in the universe such as relationships between integers 
in the universe of numbers rather than the universe of integers.
In such a case the element type is specified as a precondition using if_then
construct.
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="blue">Examples</font>:
In the examples that follow the universe is the set of numbers including real numbers, and complex numbers.
<i>I(x), E(x)</i> and <i>O(x)</i> representing "<i>x</i> is an integer", "<i>x</i> is even", 
and 
"<i>x</i> is odd", respectively.
<BR>
<BR>
"All integers are even" is transcribed as 
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <I>x [ I(x)
<img src="../symbols/imp.gif">  E(x)] </i>
<BR>
<BR>
It is first restated as "For every object in the universe (meaning for every numnber in this case)
if it is integer, then it is even". Here we are interested in not any arbitrary object(number) but a 
specific type of objects, that is integers. But if we write <img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <I>x</I>
it means "for any object in the universe". So we must say "For any object, if it is integer .." to
narrow it down to integers.
<BR>
<BR>
"Some integers are odd" can be restated as "There are objects that are integers and odd", which is
expressed as
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> <I>x [ I(x)
<img src="../symbols/and.gif">  O(x)] </i>
<BR>
<BR>
For another interpretation of this sentence see <a href="note_on_some.html" target="main"><r><font color="blue">a note 
</font></r></a>
<BR>
<BR>
"A number is even only if it is integer" becomes
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <I>x [ E(x)
<img src="../symbols/imp.gif">  I(x)] </i>
<BR>
<BR>
"Only integers are even" is equivalent to "If it is even, then it is integer".
Thus it is translated to
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/all.gif"> <I>x [ E(x)
<img src="../symbols/imp.gif">  I(x)] </i>
