<h2>A Note on Interpretation of "Some"
</h2>
</center>
<BR><BR>
"Some integers are odd" was interpreted as "There are objects in the universe that are
integer and odd" <BR>and it was translated as 
<img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> <i>x</i> [ <i>I</i>(<i>x</i>) <img src="../symbols/and.gif">  <i>O</i>(<i>x</i>)]. 
<BR>
It can also be interpreted as "For some object in the universe,
if it is integer, then it is odd". 
<BR>
In that case it becomes 
<img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> <i>x</i> [ <i>I</i>(<i>x</i>) <img src="../symbols/imp.gif">  <i>O</i>(<i>x</i>)].
<BR>
The difference here is that the former asserts that an odd integer exists, while the later 
does not assert the existence of such an object. It is a hypothetical statement.
This difference would be clearer in the following statement: 
<BR>
"Some Martians are 10 foot tall". 
<BR>
Assuming that the universe is the set of all objects, this can be transcribed as
<BR>
<img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> <i>x</i> [ <i>Martian</i>(<i>x</i>) <img src="../symbols/and.gif">  <i>10_ft_tall</i>(<i>x</i>)]
or 
<img src="../symbols/exist.gif"> <i>x</i> [ <i>Martian</i>(<i>x</i>) <img src="../symbols/imp.gif">  <i>10_ft_tall</i>(<i>x</i>)]
<BR>
The former asserts that a 10 foot tall Martian exists, while the latter does not say whether or not a Martian exists.
It is not addressing the question of existence of Martian. If a Martian does not exist, the latter statement is still true
while the former is false in that case.
