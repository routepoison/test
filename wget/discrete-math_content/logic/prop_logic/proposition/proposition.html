Sentences considered in propositional logic 
are not 
arbitrary sentences but are the ones that are either true or false, but not both. 
This kind of
sentences are called <a name="prop"><B><font color=red>propositions</font></B></a>.</P>
If a proposition is true, then we say it has a <font color=red><B>truth value</B></font> of "<B>true</B>";
if a proposition is false, its truth value is "<B>false</B>".
<P><B>For example</B>, "Grass is green", and "2 + 5 = 5" are propositions. 
<BR>
The first proposition
has the truth value of "true" and the second "false".
<BR>
<BR>
But "Close the door", and "Is it hot outside ?"are not propositions.
<BR>
<BR>
Also "x is greater than 2", where x is
a variable representing a number, is not
a proposition, 
<BR>because unless a specific value is given to x we can not say whether it is true or false, 
nor do we know what x represents.</P>
<BR>
Similarly "x = x" is not a proposition because we don't know what "x" 
represents hence what "=" means.
For example, while we understand what "3 = 3" means, what does 
"Air is equal to air" or "Water is equal to water" mean ? Does it mean 
a mass of air is equal to another mass or the concept of air is equal to 
the concept of air ? We don't quite know what "x = x" mean. 
Thus we can not say whether it is true or not. Hence it is not
a proposition.
