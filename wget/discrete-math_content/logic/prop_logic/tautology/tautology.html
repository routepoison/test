<h3>Introduction to Reasoning</h3>
<B>Logical reasoning is the process of drawing conclusions from premises using rules of inference.
</B>
Here we are going to study reasoning with propositions. Later we are going to see reasoning
with predicate logic, which allows us to reason about individual objects. However, <B><I>inference
rules of propositional logic are also applicable to predicate logic </I></B>
and reasoning with
propositions is fundamental to reasoning with predicate logic.
<BR>
These inference rules are results of observations of human reasoning over centuries.
Though there is nothing absolute about them, they have contributed
significantly in the scientific and engineering progress the mankind have made.
Today they are universally accepted as the rules of logical reasoning and they should 
be followed 
in our reasoning.
<BR>
<BR>
Since inference rules are based on identities and implications, we are going to study
them first. We start with three types of proposition which are used to define the meaning of
"identity"
and "implication".
<BR>

<h3>Types of Proposition</h3>
<P>Some propositions are always true regardless of the truth value of its component
propositions. 
<BR>
For example (P <img src="../symbols/or.gif"> <img src="../symbols/not.gif"> P)
is always true regardless of the value of the proposition P. 
<BR>
A proposition that is 
always true called a <a name="tauto"><b><font color="red">tautology</font></b></a>.
<BR>
There are also propositions that are always false such as
(P <img src="../symbols/and.gif"> <img src="../symbols/not.gif"> P).
<BR>
Such a proposition is called a <a name="contra"><b><font color="red">contradiction</font></b></a>.
<BR>
A proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called
a <a name="conting"><b><font color="red">contingency</font></b></a>.
<BR>
For example (P <img src="../symbols/or.gif"> Q)
is a contingency.
<BR>
<BR>
These types of propositions play a <B>crucial role in reasoning</B>.
In particular every inference rule is a tautology as we see in
<a href="../identities/identities.html"><font color="green"><r>identities</r>
</font></a> and <a href="../implications/implications.html"><font color="green">
<r>implications</r></font></a>.
