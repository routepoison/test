<P>
First it is informally shown how complex propositions are constructed from simple ones.
Then more general way of constructing propositions is given.
<BR>
<BR>
In everyday life we often combine propositions to form more complex propositions without
paying much attention to them. For example combining "Grass is green", and "The sun is red"
we say something like "Grass is green and the sun is red", "If the sun is red, grass is green",
"The sun is red and the grass is not green" etc. Here "Grass is green", and "The sun is red"
are propositions, and form them using connectives "and", "if... then ..." and "not" a little more
complex propositions are formed. These new propositions can in turn be combined 
with other propositions to construct more complex propositions. They then can be combined 
to form even more complex propositions.
This process of obtaining more and more complex propositions can be described more generally 
as follows:
<BR>
<BR>
<B>
Let X and Y represent arbitrary propositions. Then
<BR>
[<img src="../../../../symbols/not.gif">  X], &nbsp; [X <img src="../../../../symbols/and.gif">  
Y],&nbsp;
 [X <img src="../../../../symbols/or.gif">  Y], &nbsp; [X <img src="../../../../symbols/imp.gif">  
Y], &nbsp;
and &nbsp; [X <img src="../../../../symbols/eqv.gif">  Y]
<BR>
are <I>propositions</I>.
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Note that X and Y here represent an arbitrary proposition. 
<BR>
This is actually a part of more rigorous definition of proposition which we see 
<a href="../../../recursive_def/prop-def/prop-def.html"><r><B><font color="blue">later</font></B></r></a>.
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Example :</B> 
[ P -> [Q V R] ] is a proposition and it is obtained by first constructing [Q V R] 
by applying [X V Y] to propositions Q and R considering them as X and Y, respectively, then by applying
[ X -> Y ] to the two propositions P and [Q V R] considering them as X and Y, respectively.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="blue"><B>Note:</B></font> Rigorously speaking X and Y above are place holders 
for propositions, and so they are 
not exactly a
proposition. They are called a <I>propositional variable</I>, and propositions formed 
from them using connectives are called a <I>propositional form</I>.
However, we are not going to distinguish them here, and both specific propositions
such as "2 is greater than 1" and propositional forms such as (P <img src="../../../../symbols/or.gif">  
Q) are going to be called a proposition.

<B>Definition of Proposition (Propositional Form) --- Syntax Rules for Proposition</B>
<P>
Proposition can be described in a more rigorous way using recursive definition as follows:
<br>
<br>
<P>
A <font color="green"><EM>proposition</EM></font> (also called <font color="green">
<I>propositional form</I></font>) here is a template for propositions.
It is a 'legal' form for propositions. Every proposition must take one of these
forms. It shows how larger more complex propositions can be generated from simpler
ones in general terms.
<P>
1. <B>Basis Clause:</B> The truth values '<B>true</B>' and '<B>false</B>', and all
propositional variables
such as <B><I>P</I></B> and <B><I>Q</I></B> are a proposition. Here a <EM>propositional
variable</EM>
is a variable that takes
an individual specific proposition as its value. 
<BR>
<BR>
2. <B>Inductive Claus:</B> If <B><I>E</I></B> and <B><I>F</I></B> are propositions, then
<IMG WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline22" SRC="img1.gif"  > ,
<IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline24" SRC="img2.gif"  > ,
 <IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline26" SRC="img3.gif"  > ,
 <IMG WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline28" SRC="img4.gif"  > , and
<IMG WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline30" SRC="img5.gif"  >  are
propositions.
<BR>
3. <B>Extremal Clause:</B> Nothing is a proposition unless it is obtained by 1. and 2.
<P>
<BR>
<font color="blue"><B>Note : </B></font>As you might have noticed, <B>[ ]</B> and <B>( )</B> 
are used interchangeably for propositions.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Example</b> <br>
<br>
<IMG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline32" SRC="img6.gif"  > , 
where <B><I>P</I>, <I>Q</I>,
<I>R</I>, </B>and
<B><I>S</I></B> are propositional variables, is a proposition because
it can be obtained by first generating  <IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE 
ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline42" SRC="img7.gif"  > , 
and  <IMG WIDTH=58 HEIGHT=30 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline44" SRC="img8.gif"  >
by applying the inductive clause to the propositional variables <B><I>P</I></B> and <B><I>Q</I></B>,
and <B><I>R</I></B> and
<B><I>S</I></B>, respectively, then by combining them with  <IMG WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=10 
ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline46" SRC="img9.gif"  >
agian applying the inductive clause.
