<BR>
The extremal clause of a recursive definition can be stated in a variety of equivalent ways such as:

<ol>
<li>The set being defined is the smallest set that satisfies the basis and inductive clauses. 
<li>The set being defined is the intersection of all the set that satisfy the basis and inductive clauses.
<li>No proper subset of the set being defined satisfies the basis and inductive clauses.
</ol>
These are all equivalent and you can use any of them as an extremal clause.
