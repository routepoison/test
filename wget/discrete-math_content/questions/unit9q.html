and <img src="all.gif" width="11" height="14"alt="all.gif (70 bytes)"> <em>x</em> 
<img src="exists.gif" width="9" height="13"alt="exists.gif (61 bytes)"> <em>y</em> 
<img src="not.gif" width="11" height="6"alt="not.gif (54 bytes)"> <em>P(x, y)</em> 
have the same truth value.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>For each of the following arguments, explain which rules of 
inference are used for each step. The universe is the set of people. 
<ol type="a">  
<li>&quot;John, a student in this class, is 16 years old.&nbsp; 
Everyone who is 16 years old can get a driver's liscence.&nbsp; 
Therefore, someone in this class can get a driver's liscence.&quot;</li>  
<li>&quot;Someboday in this class enjoys hiking. Every person who enjoys 
hiking also likes biking. &nbsp; 
Therefore, there is a person in this class who likes biking.&quot;</li>  
<li>&quot;Every student in this class owns a personal computer.&nbsp; 
Everyone who owns a personal computer can use the Internet.&nbsp; 
Therefore, John, a student in this class, can use the Internet.&quot;</li> 
<li>&quot;Everyone in this class owns a personal computer.&nbsp; 
Someone in this class has never used the Internet.&nbsp; Therefore, someone 
who owns a personal computer has never used the Internet.&quot;</li></ol>

<p><strong>3. </strong>Determine whether each of the following arguments is valid.&nbsp; 
If an argument is correct, what rule of inference is being used?&nbsp; If it is not, what 
fallacy occurs?</p>
<ol type="a">  
<li>&quot; If <em>n</em> is a real number with <em>n</em> &gt 1, then <em>n</em><sup>2</sup>
&gt 1. &nbsp; Suppose that <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> &lt= 1. Then <em>n</em> &lt= 1. </li>  
<li>&quot; If <em>n</em> is a real number with <em>n</em> &gt 1, then <em>n</em><sup>2</sup>
&gt 1. &nbsp; Suppose that <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> &gt 1. Then <em>n</em> &gt 1. </li>
</ol>
