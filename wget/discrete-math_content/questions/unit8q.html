<p><strong>1. </strong>Let <em>L(x, y)</em> be the predicate &quot;<em>x</em> likes y,&quot;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Everyone likes everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Everyone likes someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Someone does not like anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Everyone likes George.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) There is no one whom everyone likes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g) Everyone does not like someone.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>Let <em>S(x)</em> be the predicate &quot;<em>x</em> is a student,&quot;
<em>B(x)</em> the predicate &quot;<em>x</em> is a book, &quot; and <em>H(x,y)</em> 
the predicate &quot;<em>x</em> has <em>y</em>, &quot; where the universe of discourse is 
the universe, that is the set of all objects.&nbsp; Use quantifiers to express each of 
the following statements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Every student has a book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Some student does not have any book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Some student has all the books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Not every student has a book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) There is a book which every student has.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Let <em>B(x)</em>, <em>E(x)</em> and <em>G(x)</em> be the statements 
&quot;<em>x</em> is a book, &quot; &quot;<em>x</em> is expensive, &quot;and 
&quot;<em>x</em> is good, &quot; respectively.&nbsp; Express each of the following
statements using quantifiers; logical connectives; and <em>B(x)</em>, <em>E(x)</em> 
and <em>G(x)</em>,where the universe of discourse is the set of all objects.
<ol type="a">  
<li>No books are expensive.</li>  
<li>All expensive books are good.</li>  
<li>No books are good.</li>  
<li>Does (c) follow from (a) and (b)? </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Let <em>G(x)</em>, <em>F(x)</em>, <em>Z(x)</em>, and <em>M(x)</em>
be the statements &quot;<em>x</em> is a giraffw, &quot; &quot;<em>x</em> is 15 feet or higher,
 &quot;&quot;<em>x</em> is in this zoo, &quot; and &quot;<em>x</em> 
belongs to me,&quot; respectively.&nbsp; 
Suppose that the universe of discourse is the set of animals.&nbsp; Express each of 
the following statements using quantifiers; logical connectives; and <em>G(x)</em>, 
<em>F(x)</em>, <em>Z(x)</em>, and <em>M(x)</em>.
<ol type="a">  
<LI>No animals, except giraffes, are 15 feet or higher; </LI>
<LI>There are no animals in this zoo that belong to anyone but me; </LI>
<LI>I have no animals less than 15 feet high.</LI>
<LI>Therefore, all animals in this zoo are giraffes.</LI>
<LI>Does (d) follow from (a), (b), and (c) ? If not, is there a correct conclusion? </li>
