<B><h2><font color="red">This course is not yet ready for Fall 2001. 
</font></h2></B>
<font color="red"><b>However</font></b>, you can see what was given 
this past semester (Spring 2001).
Fall 2001 won't be much different from Spring 2001.

<B><font color="red">At this moment this course is not ready yet.
However, below you can find what was successfully given in Fall 1999.
<BR>
<BR>
There won't be much difference this time from what you see below.
<BR>
The same textbook is going to be used and the same materials are going 
to be covered in the same order.
<BR>
<BR>
I apologize for any inconveniences this delay might cause.
I plan to update this and be ready for the Spring by Thanksgiving.

<P>This course covers the fundamental mathematical concepts and reasoning
along with problem solving techniques.
Topics covered include propositional logic, predicate logic, inferencing,
proof methods including induction, set operations, binary relations including
order relations, and equivalence relations, graphs, and functions.
</P>

<BR>

<P>This course will be <B>delivered via the internet</B>, as part of the
Computer Science Dept's <A
HREF="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~fac/teched">TechEd</A> initiative, under
the ODU <A
HREF="http://web.odu.edu/webroot/FrontEnd.nsf/pages/distlrn">Teletechnet</A>
program. There will be <B>no live (classroom or Teletechnet) lectures</B> 
for this course, although a few question and answer sessions through Teletechnet
may be given. 
Under this program, a complete upper-division (junior and
senior) CS bachelors degree program will be made available via the
internet.

<P><B>The Fall 2001 offering of CS 381 
<!--
is a <font color="red"><B>trial
run</B></font> of the
course and it 
--->
is intended for those who live near <a href="http://web.odu.edu/webroot/orgs/ao/dl/teletechnet.nsf/pages/sitelocations"><r>ODU Teletechnet sites</r></a>. 
This will be the third offering of this course via the
Internet following successful runs in Fall 1999 and Spring 2001. 
Although we will make every effort to provide a proper
learning environment for students in this class, anyone taking the
course should be prepared for the possibility, or the
probability, that some things will go wrong. 
<!--
<I>Murphy's law has not

Students who register for this course should
do so with the understanding that they are partners, with the
instructor, in trying to provide a better learning experience for the
students who will follow in subsequent semesters.  If you are the kind
of student who is easily distracted by unexpected technical problems,
then please don't take <I>this</I> class in <I>Fall 2001</I> semester.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Course Prerequisites</FONT></B>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>CS 150 (Introduction to Programming), <LI>MATH 163 (Pre-Calculus II), <BR>
or equivalents.
<LI>Calculus is preferred but not required.
<P><BR>
Students are presumed to be familiar with basic programming techniques, including the use of functions and procedures, loops and recursion. Also assumed is facility with basic algebra.
<P>
<P>Students are also expected to be familiar with the use of standard Internet-based tools including e-mail
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Technical Requirements - Hardware</FONT></B>
<P>Because this course is hosted on the Internet, you will need to make sure that you have access to the appropriate computing equipment and software to participate in the course activities.
<P>Hardware requirements are pretty straightforward.  
<P><B>Required</B>
<P>Almost any Pentium-class Windows 95, 98 or higher, or NT machine should do.  Equivalently powered Unix or Macintosh machines are also acceptable, though these may introduce other limitations regarding software (below).  
<P>

<!--
<P>The machine should be equipped with sound card and speakers.
--->

<P>
<P>Whatever the machine, a good Internet connection is essential.  You should be able to connect to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) at 28k or better. Perhaps more importantly, your ISP must be able to actually feed you information at that rate during the time periods when you will be logged in.  

<!--
It's not unheard of for people to invest in very fast modems only to find that their net access stays the same - because their ISP was too overloaded to serve up the information as fast as their modem could accept it.  Unfortunately, this is not an easy thing for individuals to determine (and few ISP's will have the candor to admit when they have too many customers for their own good).
--->

<P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=4>Technical Requirements - Software</FONT></B>
<P>Software requirements are more specific: <P><B>Required:</B>
<UL><LI>Web browser: Acceptable are Internet Explorer 4.0 or better,
and Netscape Navigator 4.05 or better<BR> Note that both of these are
available for free downloading on Windows (and Macintosh?)
platforms. Netscape is available for free on Unix platforms. 

<!--
At the
risk of starting a religious war, I will recommend that, all else
being equal, you go for Internet Explorer, because this also gives you
easy access to NetMeeting in case we need it. 
--->

<LI>Java: A Java engine is
included in your web browser.  You may need to activate it from your
browser's &quot;settings&quot; or &quot;preferences&quot;
area. Occasionally, an otherwise correctly installed browser will not
be able to run Java programs (applets).  Click <A
HREF="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/AlgAE/WeissJavaSort/sortdemo.html"><B><U>here</U></B></A>
to test the Java engine in your current browser. If a window appears,
complete with menus, buttons, etc., then all is well.
<!-- <LI>RealMedia:
Your browser should have a RealMedia player installed so that you can
receive the audio/video content of this course.  You need version 5 or
better (including the latest version, called &quot;G2&quot;).  Click
<A
href="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs361/audio/objectives.rm">here</A>
to test.  RealMedia players can be downloaded for free from <A

<LI>e-mail: Any
MIME-compliant e-mail program should do.
<LI>telnet, ftp: Any program
should do.
