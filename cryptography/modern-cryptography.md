# Modern Cryptography

In modern cryptography exist the concept of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric cryptography means that you use the same key for encryption and decryption like the Vigenere example.

Asymmetric cryptography you have two keys. One is for encryption, known as the public key, the other one is for decryption, known as the private key. Asymmetric cryptography is useful because it can be used to solve the problem of a key exchange. Additionally, it can be applied for digital signatures that provide integrity and non-repudiation.
